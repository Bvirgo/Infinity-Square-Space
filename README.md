# Infinity Square/Space.
### The prototype of the game is open source. Version 1.0

This is a prototype of a game with a procedurally generated world. The world in the game is very large and it is most likely impossible to complete the game, the whole world is almost completely destructible.

This prototype of the game is completely playable, but nevertheless, this is not a complete game.
The source contains all the tools for the development of the game, but you need the above-average programming skill. There are no comments in the code, but the code itself is well structured, all the scripts and shaders, functions and variables are named so that it is clear what they are responsible for.
